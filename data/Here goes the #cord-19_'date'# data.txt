Here goes the #cord-19_'date'# data. The specific data used in our experiments is the July 16, 200 release of CORD-19 corpus. It can be downloaded at https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases/cord-19_2020-07-16.tar.gz

In total, it's over 10GB of data, so we decided not to commit it.


With the data, the directory should look like:
